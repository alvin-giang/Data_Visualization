Data Visualization Challenge
Pymaceuticals Inc., is a new pharmaceutical company that specializes in anti-cancer medications. Recently, it began screening for potential treatments for squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), a commonly occurring form of skin cancer.
In this study, 249 mice identified with SCC tumor growth were treated with a variety of drug regimens. Over the course of 45 days, tumor development was observed and measured. The purpose of this study was to compare the performance of Pymaceuticals' drug of interest, Capomulin, versus the other treatment regimens.

Observations and Insights

1. Based on the boxplot figure, it is evident that among the four drug regimens analyzed, Capomulin and Ramicane emerged as the most effective in reducing tumor volumes. In contrast, Infubinol and Ceftamin were found to be the least effective in reducing tumor sizes.

2. There is a positive correlation between the weight of the mouses and the average tumor volume with the value of 0.84. It comes to the result that as the mouse weight increases, the average tumor sizes increase as well.

3. Based on the lineplot figure illustrating the effect of Capomulin drug on mouse L509, we can observe that Capomulin has a significant positive impact on reducing the mouse L509's tumor volume, by 8 mm3 in 15 days (from day 20 to day 35).
